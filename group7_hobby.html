                Our hobbies, no matter how big or small, bring us joy and 
                contribute to our personal growth. They allow us to unwind, 
                explore our passions, and develop new skills that can enhance 
                different aspects of our lives. Even if they seem unrelated to 
                our work or daily responsibilities, hobbies help shape our mindset, 
                boost creativity, and improve our well-being. Despite our differences 
                in interests or professions, the things we love to do make us better, 
                not just at what we do, but as individuals striving for self-improvement.

                        Game development is a journey of creativity, problem-solving, and growth. Using Godot 4, 
                        we create and upload games on itch.io, mainly for game jams that push us to think fast and 
                        refine our skills. While we've worked under time constraints, we're excited to tackle larger 
                        projects at our own pace. Game dev fuels our passion while sharpening our technical and 
                        creative abilities.

                        Reading improves our critical thinking skills and it also helps in 
                        expanding our vocabulary as reading can make us encounter familiar 
                        words and gain knowledge in knowing what it means, hence building up our 
                        vocabulary knowledge.

                        Gaming offers numerous cognitive and social benefits, enhancing problem-solving skills, 
                        creativity, and adaptability. According to Project Brain Light, games provide immersive 
                        learning experiences that improve critical thinking, memory retention, and strategic planning. 
                        They also encourage collaboration, communication, and perseverance, making them valuable tools 
                        for both personal and educational growth.
